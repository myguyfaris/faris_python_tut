'''
Arithmetic operators: +, - , *, / etc
You also have //, which is the integer division (rounds down, no dec points)
** for exponentiation
'''
a = 13
b = 3
print(a/b)
print(a//b)
print(2**5)

'''
Comparison operators:
== equals
< less than
> greater than

Equals can be combined with the not (!) operator to reverse it too
'''
c = 10
d = 5
print(c < d)
print(c == d)
print(c != d)
print(c <= d)

'''
Assignment operators (=)
You use = to assign a value to an operator
We can combine assignment operators with arithmetic operators
'''
e = 10
e += 5
'''this basically means e = e + 5
You can do the same with -=, *=, /= and so on
'''

print(e)
